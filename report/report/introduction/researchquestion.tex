\subsection{Research question}
This study aims to answer the following research question:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the LEAP-motion improve the task of building virtual block structures with respect to usability, efficiency, and speed in comparison to a mouse and keyboard interface?
\end{enumerate}
The Leap Motion is a new technology created to bring gesture based interaction to every home. 
However because the Leap Motion is still a fairly new device, not much research has been done about the interaction between the device and user.
This is why this research focuses mainly on the comparison between the two previously mentioned interfaces.  

In order to answer this question two interfaces were build to create virtual block structures. 
One with using the Leap Motion as an input modality and the other with a mouse and keyboard as input modality.
