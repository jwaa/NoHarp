\subsection{Research question}
This study aimed to answer the following research question:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the Leap Motion improve the task of building virtual block structures with respect to usability, efficiency, and speed in comparison to a mouse and keyboard interface?
\end{enumerate}
The Leap Motion is a new technology created to bring gesture based interaction to every home. 
However because the Leap Motion is still a fairly new device, not much research has been done on the interaction between this device and the user.
This is why this research focuses mainly on the comparison between the two previously mentioned interfaces.  

In order to answer this question two interfaces were build to create virtual block structures. 
One using the Leap Motion as input modality and the other using a mouse and keyboard as input modality.
