\subsection{Research question}
This study aims to answer two research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can we make an interface with the LEAP-motion to build a particular virtual block structure out of separate blocks?
\item Does the LEAP-motion improve the task of building virtual block structures with respect to usability, efficiency, and speed in comparison to a mouse and keyboard interface?
\end{enumerate}
In order to answer these questions two interfaces were build to build virtual block structures. First one with the LEAP-motion and then one with a mouse and keyboard. Then a usability study was done.
