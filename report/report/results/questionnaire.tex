\subsubsection{System Usefulness}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{system usefulness} $(Z(1) = -3.517, p = .000437, r = .622)$.. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 6.8125 and 1.8125 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:system_usefulness}.

\subsubsection{Interface Quality}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{interface quality} $(Z(1) = -3.417, p = .000632, r = .604)$. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 6.167 and 3.833 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:interface_quality}.
