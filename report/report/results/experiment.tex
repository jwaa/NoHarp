\subsection{Experiment}
Since counterbalancing has been applied no interaction effects were expected. In figure ~\ref{fig:accuracy} - ~\ref{fig:orientation_changes} this appears indeed to be the case. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were therefor performed over the combined data.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{accuracy} $(Z(1) = -3.516, p = .000438, r = .622)$. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 1.0 and .228 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:accuracy}.

\label{fig:accuracy}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Average Time}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{average time} $(Z(1) = -3.516, p = .000438, r = .622)$. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 8880 and 246428 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:average_time}.

\subsubsection{Block Repositioning}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{block repositioning} $(Z(1) = -3.414, p = .000640, r = .604)$. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 0 and 16 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:block_repositioning}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Orientation Changes}

A strong and significant main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{orientation changes} $(Z(1) = -3.297, p = .000979, r = .583)$. The medians for the keyboard and leap modes were 0 and 35 respectively. See figure~\ref{fig:orientation_changes}.
