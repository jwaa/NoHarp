\subsubsection{Keyboard \& Mouse}

\paragraph{Block manipulation}
In the keyboard and mouse interface, moving the block was solitary done with the mouse. To pick up a block the mouse button had to be clicked and held. As soon as the button was  released, the block was also released. To move the block the mouse could be moved. However, to avoid flattening the environment to a 2D environment the movement of the mouse only determines the position in the 2D grid shown. To get the block higher, the scroll wheel of the mouse was used. The reason for doing this, is to make the comparison with the LEAP motion interface more fair. Because in the LEAP motion interface, there are also three dimensions in which the hand has to move.
