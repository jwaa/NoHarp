\subsubsection{Keyboard and Mouse}

\paragraph{Building block manipulations}
In the keyboard and mouse interface, moving the block was solitary done with the mouse. To pick up a block the mouse button had to be clicked and held. As soon as the 
button was released, the block was also released. To move the block the mouse could be moved. However, to avoid flattening the environment to a 2D environment the movement 
of the mouse only determines the position in the 2D grid shown. To get the block higher, the scroll wheel of the mouse was used. The reason for doing this, is to make the 
comparison with the Leap Motion interface more fair. Because in the Leap Motion interface, there are also three dimensions in which the hand has to move.


\paragraph{View manipulations}
The view manipulations on the other hand were solitary done with the keyboard. In order to rotate the grid the left and right keys could be pressed respectively rotating the
 grid to the left or to the right at a constant pace. The up and down keys needed to be pressed in order to lift the camera up and down with a constant speed respectively.
