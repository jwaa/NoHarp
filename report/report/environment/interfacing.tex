\subsection{Interfacing}

\paragraph{Block manipulation}
For both interfaces a way to move a block from one point to another point had to be implemented. This function can be split into three subfunctions. Picking up a block, moving a block, releasing the block. First will be discussed how this was implemented in the case of the keyboard and mouse interface. After that the implementation for the LEAP motion is discussed.
