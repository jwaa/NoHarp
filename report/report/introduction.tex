\section{Introduction}
A general trend in Human-Computer Interaction is to let the computer and interaction devices adjust to the user and understand more intuitive control inputs. 
Ritter \cite{ritter2011benefits} describes the benefits of subliminal feedback loops for Human-Computer Interaction. 
A newly developed device that allows the user to communicate in a subliminal manner with the computer is the Leap Motion. 

In this project a system was developed to compare the interactions of a keyboard and mouse (symbolic communication) with the gesture based interaction of a Leap Motion 
(sub-symbolic communication). 
The system is a simple building game where the user had to build certain structures. Two different interfaces were built, providing the two different ways for the user to 
interact with the computer.
The research focused mainly on the differences in efficiency, speed and usability of these two interactions methods.

First a general description of the Leap Motion and how it works is given, followed by the research question.
