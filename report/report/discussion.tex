\section{Discussion}

This project aimed to answer the following research question: “Does the Leap Motion improve the task of building virtual block structures with respect to usability, efficiency and 
speed in comparison to a mouse and keyboard interface?”. 
In this section these points will be discussed one by one starting with the items related to the scores from the experiment: 
efficiency and speed. The remaining item, usability, will be reviewed with the results from the questionnaire.
