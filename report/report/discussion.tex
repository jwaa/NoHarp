\section{Discussion}

In the introduction two research questions were postulated. The first one: “Can we make an interface with the LEAP-motion to build a particular virtual block structure out of separate block” can be dealt with right away. The answer is: yes. The system and the experiment are proof of that. A far more interesting point is the second research question: “does the LEAP-motion improve the task of building virtual block structures with respect to usability, efficiency and speed in comparison to a mouse and keyboard interface?”. In this section these points will be discussed one by one starting with the items related to the scores from the experiment: efficiency and speed. The remaining item, usability, will be reviewed with the results from the questionnaire.
