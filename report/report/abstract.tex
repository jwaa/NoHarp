This project aimed to compare two input modalities (the Leap Motion and keyboard \& mouse) on speed, efficiency and usability.  For this a virtual task environment for
 building virtual block structures was created and an experiment was done. Sixteen people participated in the experiment. In which they had to build block structures using the Leap Motion
 and the keyboard \& mouse interface. Behavioral data was measured during the experiment. Moreover, a usability study was done and motivational data was gathered.
 Results showed that the keyboard-mouse combination is more efficient, faster and perceived as more usable than the Leap Motion.
 On the other hand the Leap Motion was viewed as fun and full of potential. Explanations of the results are widely discussed with support of behavioral and motivational data. 
 Furthermore, limitations and potential of Leap Motion is addressed.
