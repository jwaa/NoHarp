\section{Environment}

%This section describes the developed task environment for answering the research question. First of all a brief explanation will be given of what the task environment is. Then in the first section the components of the environment are described followed by a discussion of the different manipulation tasks and the LEAP Motion and keyboard and mouse control interfaces.

The task environment is a virtual graphical computer program for building virtual block structures using either a LEAP Motion or keyboard and mouse. It was developed in order to answer the research question and was created with the use of jMonkeyEngine~\cite{Irene:2012}~\footnote{More on jMonkeyEngine: \url{http://jmonkeyengine.org/}}, an open source 3D game engine written in Java. The Software Development Kit that came with the engine provided a high level interface for numerous 3D functions and data-structures (e.g. shaders, spatial manipulation, quaternions and 3D meshes) and also provided a high degree of control for developers by being completely compatible with the Java programming language. Section~\ref{sec:components} describes the components of the environment in detail.

The task environment has been developed for being a general interface were the components can be controlled either with the LEAP Motion or with the keyboard and mouse through different control interfaces. Switching between the two control interfaces was managed through a simple setting in a configuration file. The LEAP Motion control interface was developed through the LEAP Motion SDK~\footnote{Leap Motion developer: \url{https://developer.leapmotion.com/}}. Both control interfaces are described in more detail in section~\ref{sec:interface}.

% The environment is manipulated with the LEAP Motion device or with the mouse control interfaces  that are described in section~\ref{sec:interface}. employ the LEAP Motion SDK.

%Therefore most of the components of the environment are utilized by both control strategies.
