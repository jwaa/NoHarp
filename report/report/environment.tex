\section{Environment}

The task environment is a virtual graphical computer program for building virtual block structures using either a LEAP Motion or keyboard and mouse. The environment was developed with the use of jMonkeyEngine~\cite{Irene:2012}, an open source 3D game engine written in Java. The Software Development Kit that comes with the engine provides a high level interface for numerous 3D functions and data-structures (e.g. spatial manipulation, quaternions and 3D meshes) and also provides a high degree of control for developers by being completely compatible with the Java programming language. The environment has been developed for being a general interface were the components could be controlled either through the LEAP Motion or with the keyboard and mouse depending on a simple setting in a configuration file. Therefore most of the components of the environment are utilized by both control strategies. To manipulate the environment with the LEAP Motion device controllers have been developed that employ the LEAP Motion SDK.
