\subsection{Speed}

The only measure that applies to the speed of the user with the interaction device is \textsc{average speed}. The value of this measure is the amount of frames that is took, on average, to complete the three building tasks. The higher the value to lower the speed of the user. 

A strong main effect of the interaction device was found on the \textsc{average speed}. Participants were about 28 times faster using the keyboard and mouse than when they used the LEAP-motion. The most plausible explanation is that when using the LEAP-motion fast movements were poorly detected and classified. This means that the users were limited in their operational speed by the LEAP-motion hard- and software. These restrictions were absent when using the keyboard and mouse. 

Changing the task to focus more on agility then on speed would result in a more fair comparison between both interaction devices with regard to execution speed. However the limitations of the LEAP-motion in general would remain.
