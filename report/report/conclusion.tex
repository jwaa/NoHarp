\section{Conclusion}
The keyboard and mouse surpasses the Leap Motion in every way. The keyboard-mouse combination is more efficient, faster and is perceived as more usable then the Leap Motion.
 At least in the environment build for this experiment. The most important explanation for the big difference in all cases are the limitations in the hard- and software of the
 Leap Motion. These technical shortcomings are partly caused by the intrinsic properties of the Leap Motion. Another big part is our implementation. Take for example the range 
 which was too limited for implementation but on the other hand the Leap Motion was not designed for such wide operations. This lead to more mistakes in the classification of gestures 
 which accounts for a big portion of the drop in efficiency \& speed and the reported irregularities while using the Leap Motion. Furthermore participants reported fatigue while using 
 the Leap Motion. Although participant reported to be frustrated at certain points they still viewed the Leap Motion as fun and full of potential.  

In other words the Leap Motion is not suitable for a building blocks environment due to technical limitations. This can be extended to all kinds of applications where a wide range is 
needed and where users have to work with their arms for long periods of time. This does not mean that the Leap Motion can be ruled out entirely. Participants still believe it could 
work in other situations.
